The difficulty to start writing a post is real. Especially if you aren't used to blogging altogether. Plus, I guess nobody reads this, so I guess I'm writing this for myself. 

I started my socalled journey in alcoholic beverages around 10 years ago in a place that was famous to have a lot of beers, draft and bottled. I then shifted to spirits and later to wine.
I really like wine, but it feels so predictable, somehow. Shoppig for wine is straightforward, I want something like that, so I get this. With beer and cider, not so much. 
Every producers has a style, in wine, but also in beer and cider. To me, the latter two feel as uncharted territory. So much yet to discover for me. Styles getting better known, brewers trying them out. New findings in alternative fermentations, new hops.
It is ever evolving. That's probably the same for 'vin nature' (natural wine). Real short, wine made with no control, just letting the grapes ferment and bottle it. 

A small explanation because I've learned not everybody knows this:

* Cider: This is made from apples. Strongbow and the likes are alike real cider, but more akin to plain apple juice. Cider can be tangy, scrumpy, tanninous. Very diverse. 
* Perry: Cider, but made with pears.
* Beer: Should be easy, this is made from barley, water, and hops. All kinds of things can be added (think fruit and herbs) and still be beer. 
* Wine: Grapes, nothing more. 
* Yeast: A small micro organism, part of the fungi. It transforms sugar into alcohol and carbondioxide. Plus it produces flavours.
