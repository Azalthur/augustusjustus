## Introduction

I have a long time interest in plants. Around 10 years ago I had a 100 sq meter kitchen garden. That was a lot of fun, seeing al those plants grow, the produce you'd gather for a meal, very rewaring.  Then, because I moved places due to going to college I kinda dropped it all together. One of rooms I lived in had such low light conditions the Chloropythum Comosum Varriagatum didn't do exceptionally well, it was near death most of the times. Nowadays I do have huge windows, great light conditions and a newfound passion for houseplants.  That spiderplant is doing great now. Throughout this journey, the main thing I discovered, pots are expensive as hell. Plants aren't the issue, pot prices are (says every stoner). The total count should be around 41 plants, with a bit of cheating, I do have a lot of spiderplant babies.
